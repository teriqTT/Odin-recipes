<h3>HOW DO YOU MAKE CHICKEN ALFREDO BAKE?</h3>

<p>This recipe starts with a homemade cream sauce, which can be made in minutes with a little butter, flour, milk, parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, and heavy cream. 
    I typically make my sauce while I'm waiting for the pasta to cook. After the pasta and sauce are ready, they're tossed together with cooked cubed chicken, then everything goes into a baking dish. The finishing touch is a generous amount of shredded cheese.
     Bake your pasta dish until the cheese is melted and browned, then add a sprinkling of parsley and enjoy! </p>
